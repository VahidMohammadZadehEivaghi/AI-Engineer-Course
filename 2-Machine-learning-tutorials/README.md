### [Supervised Machine Learning](./supervised-learning/README.md)

- **Objective:** Learn how to build models that map inputs to known outputs.  
- **Topics:**
  - **Classification:** probabilistic classifiers, linear classifiers, decision trees, ensemble methods  
  - **Regression:** linear regression, regularization, generalized linear models  
  - **Evaluation:** metrics, bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning  
- **Learning Outcome:**  
  Gain hands-on experience designing models that **predict, classify, and make data-driven decisions**.

---

### [Unsupervised Machine Learning](./unsupervised-learning/README.md)

- **Objective:** Learn techniques to extract patterns from unlabeled data.  
- **Topics:**
  - **Clustering:** k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN  
  - **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA, t-SNE, UMAP  
  - **Density Estimation:** Gaussian mixtures, kernel density estimation

### [Reinforcement Learning (RL)](./reinforcement-learning/README.md)

- **Objective:** Introduce agents that learn to make decisions through interaction with the environment.  
- **Topics:**
  - Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)  
  - Value-based methods: Q-learning, SARSA  
  - Policy-based methods: REINFORCE, Actor-Critic  
  - Deep RL: combining neural networks with RL algorithms  
- **Learning Outcome:**

### [Deep Learning](../3-Deep-learning-tutorials/README.md)

- **Objective:** Introduce neural networks and deep architectures for learning complex representations.  
- **Note:** Deep learning is treated here as a **separate section** for clarity, as is common in existing resources. However, it can also be applied **within any of the other categories**—supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning—rather than being considered a completely separate approach.  

- **Topics:**
  - **Feedforward Networks (MLPs):** basic neural networks, activation functions, loss functions  
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** image processing, feature extraction, transfer learning  
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & Transformers:** sequence modeling, NLP, attention mechanisms, large language models  
  - **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** graph-structured data, node and edge embeddings, message passing  
  - **Regularization & Optimization:** dropout, batch normalization, Adam, learning rate schedules  

- **Learning Outcome:**  
  Gain understanding of how **deep models** can be applied to structured, unstructured, sequential, and graph-based data, as well as how they integrate with the broader ML design patterns.
